# Day 3

## Standup

Matt Severyn / Glendale

Continue with JS fundamentals with pairs.

Circles -> talk about anything but code.

## What I learnt

[array].slice() -> creates a shallow copy

Object.assign(object1, object2) -> assings all key pair values from object 2 to object 1

Object.assign({}, object2) -> creates a shallow copy of object 2.

{...object} creats a shallow copy of an object.
