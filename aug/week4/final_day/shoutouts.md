Julia - Love you Julia, you've been a great friend to me throughout this journey. I love how can nerd out together about web3, blockchain, spirituality and loads of really cool stuff. I always look forward to our sessions working together, and doing Solidity development with you in our final project was the perfect end to Codesmith. We need to do those tokenomics sometime. Also mad love for all your puppies and dogs who you share with the community

Kevin S - paired in month 2 week 2 doing intro to react stuff, so it has been some time since we worked together but it's always been a pleasure just hanging out. It's amazing to think how far you have come since then. Really wishing you all the best in your adventures in life, sending loads of love your way. Also it has been amazing to see the evolution of you hair.

Pat - what can I say about Pat. Pat is a beast with algos. He's a quiet charmer. I've put all this in your linkedin reccomendation Pat. We did some really tough technical work together, and it was loads of fun doing some of that really challenging stuff especially around the recursive caching algos. I know you're gonna absolutely smash it, and glad to have had you on my team during production project.

Sean - amazing working on Qoalition with you. They way you smashed out the FE was insane. Crazy skills there. You are a pro. But more than that you have been a great friend to me throughout this process, we connect a lot spiritually and intellectually, I feel like we could just mind jam and shoot the shit for ages. Things like you taking the time just go deep with me on my algo visualizer. We have had loads of deep conversations, so I feel a really strong connection to you, and I really appreciate that.

Valerie - Valerie you are awesome! Also been great connecting to you. Also for bringing Leo along on the ride. It has been great to connect and chat with you, we haven't worked much since we paired in think Feb, but lets stay connected!
