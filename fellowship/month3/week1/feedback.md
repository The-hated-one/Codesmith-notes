so grateful man. I'll remember you for the rest of my life. You know it. And I hope our paths cross again soon my man. GAH.

I just want to reach out say thank you for talking me through the process yesterday and meeting with me last week to run through things. Talking and laughing and doing the zoom wave really helped break the ice and made me feel more comfortable last night. :heart: I haven't been doing shout outs lately, but I wanted to send you a personal one for what you have brought to Codesmith. Shout outs are incredibly meaningful to me. It feels so good to hear your name said aloud and receive acknowledgement from the community around you. That realization hit me for the first time, ages ago, watching you do shout outs. I just wanted to take a minute to acknowledge your impact and say thank you. I am glad you are here.

Definitely. Your comments were very thoughtful and I'd definitely be up for connecting outside of class and talking about our experiences starting business and what not.

## Charlie

You did a great job man. I don't have any negative critiques. Also I think the way you went through the "take it or leave it" segments by covering up the solutions and asking someone in the class to walk through it was a great idea and it worked well!

Tom that was amazing! That gun analogy was perfect. I hated the cake analogy in the instructions. Your explanation was so spot on. I also liked your recursion approach lecture even though the material was more dense and I still need time to review it. I love your receptiveness to input from the students.

Hey Tom, your podcast transparency on Java Unscripted was freaking fantastic. I'm now officially a fanboy of yours, super inspired by your story, and grateful for your honesty sharing not just the shiny highlights of life and the journey into software engineering but the valley-lows as well. Your poem at the end was also really touching to me as I have a father and mother-in-law that struggle with depression. Anyway, thanks for being who you are, and just wanted to give you a holler. :muscle::call_me_hand:
