# Dylan feedback

When driving, don't speak out the sytnax exactly as you are writing it. Instead, say what you are going to do on a high level, and then do it, for each line of code.

Bad indentation.

Add semicolon at the end of the line.

Took over when navigating, debugging my code.

I got frustrated when I was navigating but you kinda took over, but then when I let you know you immediately respected and responded to my comment.

Really impressed by the improvement I have seen in your ability to reason and communicate at a high level.

Felt the speed of your growth, I could feel your sense of intimidation with all this knew knowledge at the beginning of the week, and I am really impressed with how you just dove into it, and overcame that!

And now I feel you have a much more solid understanding of each data type.

I can also feel your growing excitement and passion for coding.

Signficant improvement in your code styling.

Been very receptive to my feedback as we have gone along.

I feel very confident in your ability as a developer.

In the beginning, felt like I was a bit reserved.
Felt intimidated initially.
Grew exponentially.
Being patient.
Whiteboarding was great.
I am a good teacher!
The best skills that people can have are the ability to learn quickly. And communication.
An innate talent.
Speaking and communication skills are better.
Something I can really hone.
It's good thing that I really enjoy it!
It's because of you.
