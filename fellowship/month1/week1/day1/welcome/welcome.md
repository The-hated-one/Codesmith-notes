## Tech Talks

Tech Talk Review (Due one day before Tech Talk)
- One dry run is sufficient
- Primary reason is to encourage them to prepare sooner rather than later
- Focus on style not content
- Ensure slides are appropriate
- Have them ideate on questions
- Feel free to suggest they plant a question in to the audience to encourage more questions to flow

Tech Talk Set Up
- Takes place on Runway Zoom
- Make sure zoom is recording to the cloud
- Kick off the talk ("Welcome to Tech Talks! Today, Sansa and Arya will be presenting on Kubernetes! Take it away!")
- Check off Team Copy if you recommend for the talk to be considered for YouTube page
