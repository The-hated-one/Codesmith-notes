## Expedite Interviews template

Hi Hattie - I hope all is well.
I wanted to shoot over a quick heads-up that I received an offer from a different company today, and it's one that I have to respond to relatively soon.Â 
I know you have a hiring process that surely works well for you, but if there's any way to expedite that process, I'd definitely make myself available at whatever time/location works for you and your team.
Should our conversations potentially lead to an offer, I'd love to be able to consider that offer fully.

Again - very sorry to ask, but if there's any way to move things up, I'd appreciate it greatly.

Thank you!

-Tom

## Turning Down an Offer

Hi Sarah,

Hope you had a great weekend.

I wanted to say thanks again for the opportunity to be a part of the team at XYZ. It's been amazing to learn about the product you're building and the direction of the company, both from a business and an engineering perspective.

After a lot of thought, I've decided that although it is a great opportunity to be part of a small, dynamic team - ultimately, it's not the right fit for me at this time. However, I would like to recommend another engineer that I've worked with who I think would be a great fit for the role. I have attached their resume below.

Thanks again for your time and best of luck.

Best,
Shanda
