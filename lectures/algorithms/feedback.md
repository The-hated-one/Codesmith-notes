Hi Tom, Thanks for the awesome lecture! Thank you for taking the extra time to go over some complicated aspects. One quick feedback is that may helpful for the viewers is to keep the view/screen over the entire space, as it was difficult to see how areas around your outlined mapped/related to one another when closely zoomed in. The screen items weren't hard to read and finding another way to highlight the specific segments that didn't magnify the view may be helpful. Hope that helps, and hope to hear more lectures from you!

me: One person said that it was a bit too slow at points as I was asking individuals to explain such small bits of code at a time, and I was concerned that it was overly dry/boring at some points. Did you find that? Would you have appreciated me moving faster over some of the details, or did you find that useful?

I'd say that's a hard one, because you have some people at all different levels who could use slowing down and some who could use speeding up. I'd say since you only had 60 mins to focus on just the lines that concentrate on the main point, maybe just where context gets switched over for example. But I think the Rock Paper Scissors and Merge sort were spot on!

Good point you did was call on people quickly with the questions, that keeps everyone on their toes and engaged!

Great lecture today, Tom. Super helpful going through those, and your solutions were far better than what we came up with. Thank you!

Hey Tom! Thank you for the approach lecture. It was very descriptive and I was able to follow most of the time. I would like say, if would call on someone for practicing their technical communication, maybe have them go through the code a little more instead of one person doing one or two lines and another does one or two. I think you did that so you can get everyone involved, but I feel like it went really slow. But thats my opinion and the way you did it works too. Thanks again for the approach lecture. You really cleared up functionBind and mergeSort for me.

Haha Razana and I were stressing this morning :ahhhhhhhhh: We didn't see a post in the channel to meet up for Approach and were hoping you were ok

yea, figured since noone was posting in the channel they were in there. Looked like it was going really well! I liked how you built up content for bind

## Other people

- Two people motion sick from me zooming in and out of the screen


## Take home points

- More entertaining => reveal a bit of my personal life/human side
- Don't zoom in and out on the screen.
- Use a box to highlight which bit of the screen we are focusing on
- Should I speed up?
- Forgot to post @here
