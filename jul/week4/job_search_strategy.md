# Job Search Strategy

## Codesmith 2.0

1. Submitting Codesmith Style Applications
2. Mock Interview, Feedback and Iterate
3. Deepening and Broadening your T
4. Reinforcing knowledge (take homes)
5. Get Practice with algo and system design interview questions (SUPER IMPORTANT FOR FANG)
  - Use LeetCode
  - Go beyond what Codesmith teaches for System Design

Write down every single thing that happens in the interview immediately afterwards.
Write down every single question.

If there was a question you didn't write really well, iterate on it.

Next time you have a call, make sure you know the answer to that question.

# Applications vs Inbounds Overview

- Apply on the company with strong profile + resume
- Attach a credible and personal application message (sometimes known as a cover letter)
- Send a Double Down
- Send a Follow Up

Inbound Online Profiles (Great for those of you working full-time)
- Hired
- Triplebyte
- LinkedIn Inbounds

## Words of Wisdom from Grads

- Devote 80% of your mental and emotional energy to the application process. The remaining 20% devoted to studying -- is the treat you give yourself for having put yourself out there, failed and learned what you need to polish your answers on.

- Treat applying like a job. If you invest a few hours a day to applying, you will get results.

- Get 3-5 apps out a day! You need to work very hard and get apps out right out of the gate so that you can iterate and improve!

## Studying, Breadth and Depth

Work outward from your resume
- Learn how to *talk* about the tech you've used
- Dive deeper
- Follow the thread. Work outward
- Turn Gray Squares Green

- When I first started applying, I had to apply and interview with the resume right in front of me to make sure I was hitting all the bases on what I wanted to speak to. After doing enough applications, it became part of my memory. Apply, apply, apply! You become much more comfortable with your experience and background when you see it and use it consistently.

## Algorithm Strategy

"Play Like you Practice"
- Time yourself - 20-30 minutes and then look at a solution
  - Talk it out & communicate
  - 30 minutes of pseudocode
- Not getting stuck, not being stubborn. Learn from well-written code. Circle back.

- Record yourself, and re-watch it

- Use the `Algorithm Tracker` to keep track of your algo progress.

## Support System

Some Ideas
Daily Hack Hours, Daily Stand Ups, Co-Applying, Post Interview Reflection, Check-Ins

- Lean on your cohort mates, it's hard to ask for help, but there's so many people willing to guide you through the hard parts of job searching.
- Get a group of 4 or 5 for support

## Scheduling Ideas

- Time Blocking
- Eat your Frogs First
  - Do your applications first thing
- Practice like you'll play
- Accept the iteration process

- Codesmith gives you a good starting point - but in the ned you need to figure everything out for yourself! What works for someone else doesn't always work for you! Iterate and find what works for you; pay attention and see if methods are working for you, if they're not change them accordingly.

## Some Last Tips

- Like when dating, don't be bitter, be grateful, really give a shit. Network actively
- Follow the Codesmith advice, follow Eric and Will's tips.
