# Velocirabbit

- Luis and Ryan very much dominating conversation
- Jay, Jireh and Sara much quieter
- Thinking of doing an electron app/app chrome dev tool
- Jireh seems to be technically strongest, quietly taking the lead in this arena. Has a clearer idea about the actual problem and how to solve.
  - Is thinking of using a 'core dump' strategy and flame maps to analyse potential memory leaks.
- Sara very reservered

## Update - team Velocirabbit in the mids:
- Luis and Ryan, particularly Luis very much dominating conversation
- Jay, Jireh and Sarah much quieter
- Luis has been interviewing this week
- Ryan is also interested in interviewing/looking for jobs now
- They are thinking of doing an electron app/chrome dev tool, not sure atm
- Still fleshing out their idea but making good progress
- Jireh seems technically strongest and has the clearest understanding of the problem and potential solutions, and seems to be taking the lead there
- The team as a whole seems pretty happy with their idea and direction and seems pretty unified
- Sara was particularly reserved/quiet
- Jay is quiet until I ask him a question then he has a fair bit to say and seems in pretty solid spirits
