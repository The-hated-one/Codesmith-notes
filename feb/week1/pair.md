Ask clarifying questions.

Also sometimes you go quiet when you are thinking, which is actually very natural and common, but can present a problem especially during coding interview, where they want you to verbalize your thought process.

I know that often it is easier to think more clearly when you are silent, but as an interviewer they will regard it better if you are able to continuously verbalize your thinking process, so they can get an idea what is going on in your head.
