^^^ Cultural Issues Guidebook ^^^

- YOU ARE NOT A THERAPIST
  - If someone has suicidal tendencies, you are not trained for that

# What to do if:

- If someone says they can't turn up for a day/attendance:
  - Reach out to laura and let them know, because she is in charge of your absence

- They don't want to work together
  - Why do they feel that way?
    - How can we find a way around that

- If an issue comes up e.g. bulldozing:
  - Frame it in terms of what we are looking for in terms of senior software engineers

- Withdrawals/deferrals
  - Try and encourage them
  - Let Laura know

- If they haven't prepared/refactored/have questions for an APC
  - Tell Laura
  - Tell them they will have to reschedule

- Dealing with mental health problems:
  - "I'm not comfortable or qualified to give you advice on this, but I can give you a list of resources that may be able to help you. I can't speak to the effectiveness of any of these options, and they're not endorsed by Codesmith, but it would make me feel better if I knew that you were seeking out professional help."Â
