# Technical Answers Prep

Tell me about your React experience?

Recently I was building a new type of GraphQL Client for React.
Due the increasing complexity and performance demand of front-end applications we have seen the development of Atomic State Management and I really believe this is the future of Front-End State management.
Anyway I found there was no GraphQL Client that currently supports Atomic State, and I found there was a lot of demand for this on sites like Reddit and discord So I decided to build it myself.
So me and a team of engineers decided to work on solving this problem at a Tech Accelerator called OSLabs.
So we could have gone with focusing on supporting Angular, Vue or React, but we decided to focus on supporting React

There are 3 key points that led me to focus on building this library for react
- Due it's uni-directional data flow, it was most in need of an Atomic style state management solution
- We would be able to store data directly in the react fibre tree, which meant we could build the product with minimal dependencies.
- It has a large enough developer community that I felt the product could make a real impact

In retrospect rather than building a new GraphQL Client from scratch, we could have created a new caching layer to plug into Apollo Client because we could not match the number of features available.

That makes me wonder what your experience of managing state in React, the reason I ask is because I hear you are using redux, but I think Redux is no longer necessary for most projects.

## Feedback

### What I did well

- Made himself relatable to the interviewer.
- Kept in conversational
- Hooked in a question to keep the interviewer excited.
- Structured it out with numbers that made it digestible.
- It was easy to follow the 3 points
- The React is the future point was the weakest point
- Planted seeds about atomic state management
- I was really present and always listening
- Continued to listen and take control of my attention and contributing to the conversation
- Enjoyed how I continued the conversation
- How I pivoted away from React into state management and redux
- The follow up question with using Redux
- And doing a good job with having an opinion
- Responded back after listening
- Said I loved the question

### What I could improve

- Asked a question after the first answer, but could have asked more questions after the first question.
- Did notice that when I started talking about React in the beginning.
- Lecturing the interviewer - should have assumed that the interviewer already knows.
  - Watch out! You were trying to teach the interviewer.
  - Always assume that they know exactly what you are talking about.
- Having such a strong opinion about using redux.
- Trying to ask a question that leads to what I can contribute rather than saying redux is bad/you should be using redux thing.
- Could have been a great opportunity to talk about a situation where you had to make a tradeoff between keeping some legacy code.

I could see that not name-dropping the app could be a good way to fish for an indicator of interest from the interviewer (being vague about what the project was and then getting a question “What was that application called?” — Tells you they were interested enough to know and gives you another opportunity to flex with more results.

## Phillip feedback

- Should have said the name of the product.
- Making me care - linking it to a significant
- The bit about reddit => remove the reddit bit!
  - Instead we identified the issue within the graphql community
- Brought in OSLabs => loved that
- Could have done with angular and view
- 3 things
  - uni directional data flow
  - stored data within the react fibre tree
  - 3rd point that react is the future (how to polish it up?)
- Thomas even hedged by saying building the client from scratch was not the best idea => loved this bit

- The question
  - Liked the question
  - Fine line between asking an opinionated question and genuinely wanting feedback
    - VS. the fine line => the question is a bit attacky.
    - Change up the bit => most projects nowadays don't need redux
      - Instead maybe mention some problems you experienced

- I love redux, it was the first state library I learned
  - I am curious because I have been doing a lot of work recently and it solves a lot of those issues
  - I am curious whether you have had any of those issues

- Loved how I brought in Recoil and Jotai.
