## Ideas

- Habit => Self from the past talking to your future self
- Dating => Much more explicit requirements => people would have prompts and guidelines they have to meet to get into the network
- iWatch => tennis tracking app
- Track expense => insurance 
- Social Zoom application => 1st person view should be default
