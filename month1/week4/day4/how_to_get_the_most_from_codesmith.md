# How to get the most out of Codesmith

## Why are you here?

Think about this.

## Two core mentalities we're instilling

Mentality 1: You will find the answer to the problem if you're resilient and follow the right steps

Mentality 2: Code, code, code. Build projects you care about - don't 'learn to code'.

## Plus some other things

Mentality 1 + 2:
- Map of programming
- Modern JavaScript (FE & BE)
- Excellent technical communicators - Learning through teaching
- Empathetic engineering (support each other and your community)

## How can you achieve this most effectively?

1. Never forget that getting a mid or senior software engineering role is incredibly hard

- People spend 4 years getting a software engineering job - you're doing it in 38 weeks in the evenings and weekends!
- Every minute counts
- Focus on Codesmith
- Find the balance with help-desk!
  - Research, Parse, Implement

2. Support each other - engineering empathy

- Give talks to share your knowledge
- Help out when you get ahead - don't focus on completing extensions
- Go above and beyond in supporting the community

3. Fight imposter syndrome

- You're meant to struggle with the challenges even after the lecture
- Measure yourself against yourself and care for each other
- The measure of accomplishment at Codesmith is
 your personal growth, not whether you complete the challenges in 1 week.

4. Use your out-of-class time effectively

1. Pair through previous challenges you didn't complete
2. Pair on hack hour challenges
3. Pair through to finish challenges
4. Solo on challenges (on a separate branch)
5. Build projects
6. Hang out with the team/classmates
7. Sleep and recuperate

5. Trust the process

- Struggle is not always a comfortable experience but it makes you a great engineer
- Infrastructure of support vs Hand-holding => Autonomous problem solvers
- Through the struggle, you are growing your capacity, not just receiving technical knowledge
- Use help desk effectively
- Immerse yourself in the core - don't get distracted by side projects

6. Growth Mindset

- Respond to feedback
- Avoid a 'fixed mindset' that some people have 'it' and some do not. You have the capacity to grow, that is why you are here
- Self-analyse
- Give constructive feedback

You are part of Codesmith's family!

They will give you feedback on your CV etc. years down the line if you need it.
