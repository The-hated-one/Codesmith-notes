# Day 2

- Create a chat
  - Me, Laura, Matt, Tom
- Biggest thing is communication
- Have to do 90 mins elsewhere

- APCs and Office Hours will be time that is best for them.
- The best time for that is right before class.


- Putting in extra time.
- Putting in work before time.

- Heads up for me
  - Assigned me to be with the group for Alex Campling
  - There is a good chance he will no longer be in the program at the end of the week.
  - They may need more support than any other group.
  - They have assigned me to the group specifically because there will be changes in the group.

- Be empathetic and supportive of the entire group.
  - Be very present.
  - Don't harp on Alex himself.
  - A group of 3 is still a very powerful group.

- Jack
- Travis
- Sam Johnson
