It's a real honour to be interviewing with you today, I've been very impressed with the work you have been doing at Chainlink.
I'm an engineer currently working day to day on React, Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo, Django and Python.
It's actually really interesting you are using TypeScript because my specialism is in GraphQL and particularly developing advanced custom directives.
I am interested to know if you as a team have considered using GraphQL because it works really well with TypeScript.
