# How to Give Lectures

- What question can you ask to make sure everyone is on the same level?
- Link it back to prior context
- Know everyone's name
- Practice the demos

- Call specific people
  - Keep students on their toes!

- If they weren't listening
  - Playful disapproval
    - Then move straight on

- Do not ask general questions
  - ASK SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
    - You'll either get that one person answering, or tumbleweed

- Ask for thumbs
  - Up means 'Makes perfect sense'
  - Side means 'clarification/questions'
  - Down is always a joke of your choosing
  - 1-2 times per lecture

- Pose discussion questions
  - Tell them to pair up for 30-60 seconds
  - Share answer at end
  - 1-2 questions per lecture
    - E.g. 'Here's our block of code, what do we think is going to happen in this code'
    - OR 'For the next 60 seconds explain to each how this is going to work'
      - Then ask for thumbs

- Drive points home
  - Take the main points
    - Say it slowly, repeat it, gesticulate with your hands
    - Pause before and after them
    - Use tone of voice

## Hard questions

- Delay - "great questions, we'll come back to that later"
- Bounce - send the question with audience if you know someone really knows it
- Play - tell them to code up the idea and share the result with everyone
