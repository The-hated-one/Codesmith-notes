## Feedback Kevin

I have been patient, I am making sure that I understand it, and am trying to make sure that you understand it. I do really good job at explaining these quirky/weird concepts.

All positive

## Feedback for Kevin

Be more specific with your debugging.
You said -> Cannot read type error, bind is undefined.
Actually -> Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined.

Using 123, as it is easy to read, vs using convention.

Good to see you suggesting useful console.logs.

# Learnt

export default -> single export -> import NO {}
export -> multiple exports -> import {}
