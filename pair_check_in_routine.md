# Pairing routine

## Start of the session (time ~5 mins) - 5 steps

1. Emotional Check-in
  - Ask you partner how they are feeling. Share how you are feeling.
2. Full disclosure.
  - Share any challenges you have had with pair programming (i.e. I have been known to bulldoze in the past)
3. What do you want to get out of this? What is your motivation?
  - Ask your partner what they most want to get out of the session.
4. Encourage feedback.
  - Tell your partner that you actively encourage feedback, you so can become a better pair programming partner
5. Discuss pairing strategy.
  - Come to an agreement on how you want to pair. If you are doing driver/navigator, how often will you switch? Every 20 minutes? Or after each problem? Make sure you both understand each other expectations of how you will work together.

## End of the session (time ~5 mins) - 2 steps

1. Ask for any feedback
  - Feedback does not need to wait until the end of the week, by then it is too late! Get feedback from each other as you go along and continuously improve.
2. Finish with appreciation at the end of the day.
  - Share something positive at the end of your session. This helps to strengthen your connection with your pair programming partner.
