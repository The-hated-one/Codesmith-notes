Also mad love for all your puppies and dogs who you share with the community

Sean - amazing working on Qoalition with you. They way you smashed out the FE was insane. Crazy skills there. You are a pro. But more than that you have been a great friend to me throughout this process, we connect a lot spiritually and intellectually, I feel like we could just mind jam and shoot the shit for ages.
