# Grading

- Look at the student
- Pull down their code
- Evaluate it


- 4 categories
1. Pass - mostly working clean code
2. Borderline without APC - half to 2/3 of the code working, but they get it
3. Borderline with APC - most of the code doesn't work/it's super ugly, they don't seem to get the core concepts
4. Fail - they really don't get it

- Do they get it?
- Knowledge gaps

- For each assessment there is a rubric
- Use pluses and minus' when going through the grading
  - Note worthy positives and negatives => this is all private
- Then there are notes that are sent to the resident

Easier to write these a google doc and then copy them into the google sheet

- Grading Notes / PTRI 4 / Database Assessments / Template [Student Name] - [Git Hub Handle] - Database Assessment Notes

Then paste it into the sheet.

Just add:
  - Academic Notes
  - Pass/Fail
  - Notes to Student

Be to the point.

A fellow is going to be reaching out to schedule an APC with you.

## Reaching out for an APC guidelines

- They should use your notes to refactor
  - If they haven't refactored => NO APC!
- They should be coming to you with questions
- You should not be refactoring their code

## Grading process

- Clone from CodesmithLLC
  - e.g. CodesmithLLC/database-assessment
- `git switch jackvhall`
- OR if not found
- `git switch -c grading`
- Overview the code
- Go through the schema
  - As you go through the schema, write out the message to the student
    - If they crushed it, give further tips
- Can use postman to test routes

- Checkout Matthews for a good example
