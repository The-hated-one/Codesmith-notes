# Hiring

Erik Kirsten

Salary in SF and NY: 120-160K
Salary in LA: 110-140k

Mid Level Engineers have a certain level of swagger.

The number one problem is sounding Junior.

A lot of it comes across in terms of how you present yourself and your confidence.

A student recently came out with $192k, not a good college/science background.

$140k is normal.

The question is a matter of getting the right first job.

If you're willing to come outside of your comfort zone, you can go to FANG.

They will ask you 'So tell me about yourself'?

And the other what are you looking for? What's your salary? What's your range?

For the 'So tell me about yourself' question, you NEED to have prepared an answer.

What they are asking is what your technology story is.

When did you see your first line of code.

Don't use the words 'project' or 'coding bootcamp'.

Think of it as your production 'product' or 'platform'.

Your building something under a tech accelerator, an open source product that does x.

The dream interview is not waiting for them to ask you questions and then answering them well.

The best interview is the same as sitting and having coffee with somebody. It's a conversational back and forth.

You are conversing about tech.

Replace the word interview with conversation. It's not a phone interview, it's a technical conversation.

The number one thing on a persons mind when you talk to them is 'will this person detract from my company culture?'.

Most interviews is a bland lack of passion.

Always stay rooted in one thing: Passionate Engineer who loves to build cool shit.

You have to talk with energy, passion, speed.

The interviewer is not excited about having an interview. Surprise them.

Get them talking about everything you can, and then have that conversational back and fourth.

If it's gets to a question you've dropped the ball a little, it should remain a back and fourth.

The most successful people are incredible communicators.

The passion and energy is everything.

You come in with a 45 second narrative, what technologies you are excited about, then follow with a question 'Oh and I've been dying to ask...'.

Does not recommend lying.

Trust Annie on your resume, she is a master of that.

Don't come across with this wide-eyed junior kinda vibe.

You need some swagger.

You should expect 20% of your applications convert to phone screens.

I know what I know and that's a lot. And I am comfortable with what I don't know.

Be that excited engineer.

Watch out for your resting face. Be aware of resting face when you are in zoom or in an interview.

You must be a welcoming listener.

Make eye contact. Body posture should always be forward.

Nobody is hiring your for the engineer you will be on day one.

What they want to see is someone who is going to bring energy.

The right way to answer for

Most of the jobs I've looking have been $120k trending to $160k on the high side to be honest.

Mid level and senior engineers make sure they are not leaving any money on the table.

Nobody is looking to save a few bucks on an engineer.

They want someone passionate to dive in and build.

You can't negotiate for a better health plan/401k/vacation. You can offer negotiate for equity grants. Negotiate for salary even if you are happy.

Startups are not a great thing to do for you first job. The startup will probably offer you less salary for more stock options.

A startup is someone who has raised less than $5-10m bucks.

Go to crunchbase.com on any company and look at what they have raised.

Look at the founders, they are the best indicator of success for a company. See if they have a track record.

Most recently **I was fortunate enough to get accepted into a tech accelerator called OSLabs**, and work with a really great team, and we worked on building...

Once you get to 100 employees it starts to get a little more mid sized.

**Keep the range $30-40k.**

**The bottom should keep you happy. The top should have you doing cart-wheels.**

It wasn't that type of position, it was something that I wanted to build, I was excited to build, and OSLabs was able to provide the resources for that.

Eric's advice is not to try and raise comp internally. Just go after the next job as if you are leaving the company.

Find a home where you will thrive and crush it as an Engineer. The pay should be fantastic as well.

Wow thank you so much that is really exciting, are you okay if I take the time to talk it over with family and discuss the offer.

Hey I have been made another offer, and I really want to stay here, but I have been made an offer of x. Will you be able to match it?

Senior Engineers often manage other Engineers. Knowledge of the industry, of the competition. You know more than just how to write code, you care about the funding and macro stuff.
