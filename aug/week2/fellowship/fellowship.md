  - Presentation
6. Reviewing resumes
7. **Grading**
   - This possibly takes the most amount of time

  - Current company is great, but we grow so big so fast, so current structure and policies are not well polished.

### What do you look for when you are looking for a new opportunity?

1. Who are the people behind the company? Who is in the leadership roles? Who will you be working with during day to day life?
