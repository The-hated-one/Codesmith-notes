## Josh

Actually quit. Showed up to say goodbye to Ashley, that talk with her changed everything for me. Josh withdrew his vacancy. Realized the community here was untapped potential. 

Can't convey in words, how grateful he is. Couldn't have picked a better group of people to share this journey with.

## Xiao

Wasn't certain that she would go through with the career switch, but is so much happier now.
At one point Codesmith was too much, with the new product management job, she struggled, had a long chat with Matt, had a lot of reassurances

## Ashley

It's a bitter sweet moment.

## Frank

Everyone annoys me, that they are so young, smart and have such amazing futures ahead of them.
