# How to Pair Program

### USING GIT

Each partner adds two remote links to their cloned repo on their own local workstation: one to CodesmithLLC's repo, and one to the partner's repo:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/unit-1-js-fundamentals.git
git remote add partner https://github.com/PARTNERS_GITHUB_HANDLE/unit-1-js-fundamentals.git
```

### Ground rules - Reid Klarsfeld
Turns the chat off.
Use the raise hand feature if you have a question.
If you really need to you can unmute yourself to ask a question.

## Notes

- Driver -> person with hands on the keyboard:
  - Focus on coding and executing based on the directions provided by the navigator.

- Navigator (person explaining approach) -> The person giving directions:
  - Should focus on the strategy, what to use and how to use it.

Lets say you're working on algorithm. One person is going to be typing out the algorithm. The other is going to be thinking and explaining an approach.

## Navigator ettiquette

- Don't be too specific, let the driver interpret it accordingly:
  - E.g. say iterate through the array, not use a for loop
- Don't tell them to oh no stop that is not what I was saying:
  - Let the driver get through even though it was not the way you were anticipating.
  - If it goes wrong now you have the opportunity to teach.
  - Perhaps you will be surpised that they come up with a way to solve the problem you didn't think of.

Either you are teaching or you are learning.

Rotate when you are done.

## Driver ettiquette

- If you are driving and you know the answer, but your navigator is stuck let them struggle!

## Benefits

- Collaboration (spotting issues, navigating solutions, WORKING TOGETHER)
- Two heads are better than one
- Results in fewer coding mistakes
- Effective way to share knowledge
- Technical communication!

## What not to do
- Avoid words like 'move that'
  - Or 'take this and move it there'
  - Be specific
- Don't take too many breaks.
- Don't do work when your partner isn't there
- Be mindful of how long and often you're taking breaks. 5-10 mins max. PUSH THROUGH THE 3 HOURS.
- Bulldozing:
  - Your way isn't gonna work.
  - That won't work.
  - Let the person with less experience navigate.
  - Guide towards the answer with questions.
  - There should never be this moment where one person is just doing everything.
  - Check in - am I bulldozing?
- Inneficient setup
  - Cluttered Desktop
  - Dual-screen -> make sure you are staying engaged, make eye contact with your partner.
- Use two laptops for researching

## What to do

- Go with it even if it may not be right.
- Designate drive and navigator (one person codes, on person talks)
- Set time till switch (shoot for every 10 - 15 mins or after every problem)
- Breaks - talking is exhausting. Shoot a break for a few minutes every 30-min or so.
  - Don't take more than a couple of mins.
  - 5 mins break time ish over the full 3 hours.
- Address weaknesses and work on them (ex. talking too fast. be open to giving and receiving *constructive* feedback!)
- Asking questions if something isn't crystal clear. If the wrong language is used, ask clarifying questions (technical communication!)
- Be cautious of using two laptops for research.
  - Use one instead and communicate through it.
- Engage with your partner. TALK.
- Struggle
- Help desk after 45-min. or 30-45 mins.
- Ask you driver for help if you are super stuck.

### When the model doesn't fit -> moving from algorithms to react

- Still have one person coding.
- How do we think we should solve this?
  - Less strict, more two way navigating.

## Personal tips taken from Makers

- Start with emotional check-in.
- Full disclosure.
- What do you want to get out of it? What is your motivation?
- Vision hacking:
  - What would be your dream pair programming?
  - What would be your nightmare pair programming session?
- Ask for feedback:
  - What did I do well?
  - What could I improve on?
- Appreciations at the end.
- Emotional communication.
- Ping pong is an option.
