## Intro To Writing  A Resume for Software Engineering

- Think 'What, how, why (micro), why (macro)'.

- What technology did you use?
- How exactly was the technology implemented.
  - Reference the common definition of the technology.
  - Pinpoint a specific feature of the technology.
- Why was implementation used in the scope of your application?
  - Micro
    - Why was it used in the scope of your application?
  - Macro
    - Why did you use that technology as opposed to a different technology.
      - Find one thing that your tech does, a comparative advantage.
- Final
  - Synthesize into a single bullet point.

If you don't know why you used a certain technology, go and do research and find out a reason why.

The resume prep doc is super important. Fill it out.

### Best Practices

- Focus on the most **relevant, impressive** and **technical** experience.
- Showcase a highly sophisticated understanding of core technologies.
- Examples of technical decision making and problem solving.

- You have to speak to your resume in interviews.
  - Make sure it is a resume that makes you feel comfortable and confident.

- Focus on **technical components** of all experience.

- Be conscientious of the focus of your resume.
  - If you're aiming for FE roles, focus on FE tech.
  - If you're aiming for FS roles, show a balance between FE and BE.

### Do's and Don'ts 

- Do's
  - Remove all non-technical bullet points from your resume.
  - Use core proper nouns - "Node.js", "React", "GraphQL", "AWS", "JavaScript".
  - Surround core proper nouns with highly sophisticated technical "how's" and "why's".

- Don'ts
  - Invent prior experience.
  - Describe stuff you don't understand.
  - Copy others resume bullet points.

##  Experience

### Production Project

- Use the Resume Prep Doc to build out this section.
- Highlight your contribution to the open source community - include "Open Source" in the title.
  - Reactide (Open Source Product)
  - Reactide || Open Source
  - Reactide // Open Source Contribution
- 6 bullet points minimum, more if you have no prior technical experience.
- Make sure you have some deployemnt/dev-ops decisions and testing.
  - Ex. Configured Travis CI to execute test suite on custom events.
- Reference Node.js and React in production project bullets.
  - If it's an electron project reference "Built with Node.js runtime (in Electron)".
- Last bullet should include:
  - "Product developed under tech accelerator OS Labs (opensourcelabs.io)"

### Prior Professional Experience

- Software Engineering
  - Use the same format from your resume prep doc, what how why why
    - Especially the "why" in terms of mature engineering challenges, exs:
      - Server latency
      - Rendering performance

**30 minutes in are the example resume for people with software engineering experience.**

### Education

- Include name of the university, the years you attended, but leave off B.A. or B.S.
- If you're a very recent grad (>2 years) may be best to leave graduation year off.

### Interests

- Personal and specific.
  - Not just "Hiking and pizza", where do you like to go hiking, what kind of pizza do you like?

## More pointers

- 550 word minimum.
- For you first draft it can be longer than 1 page.
  - Once you come round to your final draft, you can get around to 1 page.
