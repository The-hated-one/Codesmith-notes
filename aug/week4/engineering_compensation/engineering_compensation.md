# Engineering Compensation

- One person had a picture on LinkedIn that was stiff and formal and they weren't in a suit. That was failing them.
- One person used their nickname on their online profiles and CV, that was stopping them.
- One person was taking ~10 seconds to reply to how are you? They would pause for 5-10 secs of dead silence, then say I'm good. In real life it was endearing, but on the phone it was weird. Changed that and he got hired.

- Focus on applying to jobs more than studying.
- Role with the phone screen in a casual way.
- Don't think of it as an interview, think of it as a conversation.
- At the end of phone screens, please **ASK EXTERNAL RECRUITERS:**
  - **Would you mind giving me an idea of some of the companies and job titles you've placed with recently?**
    - If they have a bad response, just move on.
    - They should be placing people in high level positions and with FAANG etc.

- You're gonna start getting these phone screens
- They will get better and better
- With on sites, just roll with whatever comes your way!
  - If you're talking to a HR or sales person, don't get deep in the weeds on tech stuff!
    - If you need to get into technical stuff, explain it in a way that they can feel excited and understand.
    - Know what their job title is, and respond appropriately.

- If you're talking to engineers, go HARD into the tech.
  - Ask them about their products
    - What are you are excited about? What are you worried about?

- You can get a job easily.
  - You should be thinking, is this a great place for me.

- 6-8 weeks in things really start to happen for people who go for it.

Eventually:

Hey Ashley would you be free tomorrow to speak to our head of HR/CTO/team lead.

1. Send the expedite interview email to EVERYONE in your pipeline IMMEDIATELY.

- We'd like to offer you $125k, 10-15% on top of that.
  - DO NOT SAY YES OR NO
  - Thank you so much, that's so exciting, are you cool if I take a few days just to consider the offer fully and talk it over with family.
    - This bought you 3-4 days

2. Interview with every other company in the pipeline.

- Â£115k offer
- $135k offer
  - Everything else is equal (love for company etc.)
  - This never happens though, there is always some kind of tradeoff
  - Maybe if the $115k was bumped up to $135k I would go for that one

- After 2-3 days, what whatever's going to feed you as an engineer the most, NEGOTIATE THAT ONE.
- You can negotiate time off after you have closed the deal.
- If they say no:
  - Let me just ask you this, is there any chance you guys would be able to bump me up with a one time signing bonus of $15k.

BE THE PERSON WHO ADVOCATES FOR THEMSELVES

- Focus your negotiation on salary:
  - DO NOT NEGOTIATE FOR STOCK OPTIONS/SALARY

- Early stage startup's will try and get you for ~$80k vs $130-140k and sell you the dream of stock options that blow up.
- Erik talks to the other investors, investors who didn't invest, the competition etc.

- The way you find a startup is not through a job opening on LinkedIn:
  - Be an external facing engineer, who goes to lunch with other engineers, people in sales and marketing, people in other companies.
    - Hey Eric, that person you had lunch with the other day, we think you'd be a great fit on the team
    - Do it through networking, through lunch, through coffee.

- Work for a mid-sized to larger company. Work for the best brand you can. Go for FAANG if you can.
  - It's the thing that gets your company funded, when you put your name up on a slide.
  - For this first gig go for something with a solid name, that will set you up for life.

## What number are you looking for

The jobs I've been looking at are in the $120-$150k range trending on the higher side.

## Options & Stock

- When it comes in the offer letter, we'd like to offer you $130k salary + $10k stock options with a 1 year cliff and a 4 year vesting period
  - The 1 year cliff means you don't get any for 1 year.
    - On the 1 year anniversary, I'm going to take 25% of those stock options, and slide them across to Julia's pile.
    - For the next 3 years after that, on the same date every month, you get a cut of the rest.

- Options are what you are going to get
  - A stock option is an agreement, that you have a right to buy stock from a company at a certain price
  - So hopefully you can buy at say a $1 strike price for shares that are worth $20, so you get $19 profit for each one.

- Usually you get 90 or 60 days to exercise or not exercise your options.
  - You have to decide whether you believe it is worth it.

- Once you buy/exercise the options, they become shares.

- Once options vest and you exercise them, you pay capital gains tax.

## RSU's

- Restricted Stock/Share Units
  - Offer you $130k salary + $30k in RSU's with a vesting period of 4 years
  - At the end of the period when you vest, you get the number of shares that are worth exactly that amount
    - Less of gamble, a more sure bet.

## Hour billing

- Look for $6-7 bucks an hour extra

## Things you can't negotiate

- Can't negotiate your 401k, vacation days, your health insurance

### Tips

- Take your vacation
- Don't blow off things like commute times -> THIS IS IMPORTANT
  - Negotiate something like a moving bonus of $5k
    - Or negotiate 3 days of work from home a week etc.

- When you say can you get back to me in a few days time, don't leave it until the very last minute.

- Really grateful for the offer, AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING. However I feel like this is a perfect fit. So I'm not gonna ask you to hit the top of that range, but if you could just slide up $10k I could sign this today.

## Why did you leave question

- NEVER GO NEGATIVE
  - You say their goals and my goals didn't quite match up
    - I didn't think the marketplace was quite as mature as they did
    - You could explain it in terms of a certain technology you wanted to work with.
    - Try to stay a year.

## If they say you don't have enough experience

- I actually have the skill level of about 3-5 years of experience, so if you could just check that box, that would be great.
