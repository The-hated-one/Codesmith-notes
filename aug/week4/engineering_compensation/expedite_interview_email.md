# Expedite Interviews Email

Hi Hattie - I hope all is well.
I wanted to shoot over a quick heads-up that I received an offer from a different company today, and it's one that I have to respond to relatively soon.Â 
I know you have a hiring process that surely works well for you, but if there's any way to expedite that process, I'd definitely make myself available at whatever time/location works for you and your team.
Should our conversations potentially lead to an offer, I'd love to be able to consider that offer fully.

Again - very sorry to ask, but if there's any way to move things up, I'd appreciate it greatly.

Thank you!

-Tom
