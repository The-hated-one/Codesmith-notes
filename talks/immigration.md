Michael is an immigration attorney.

### How to best approach companies regarding visas.

Basic research you should do:
Will send over some materials.

1099 vs w2s.

LinkedIn profile questions. Visa adjudication.

### Categories

- H1B
- O1
- TN - canadians and mexicans
- E3 - australians
- L1 - intracompany transfer/treaty traders/investors
- E1 or E2 perhaps if starting a business.

All of these are considered a temporary working visa.

- B1 - visitor for business or pleasure

If you are working remotely for a US company, you may have to visit using a B1.

They won't launch a greencard process, until you already over there working.

- J1 -> Exchange visitor visa -> can get paid to work in the US.
  - Two categories of J1 for technical jobs.
    - J1 trainee
    - J1 intern

- L1 for intra-company transfer. Not an option for most people

### CPT Mills

Immigration service - not recommended.

Basically a masters degree you pay for based on work experience.

## E1 Visa

E1 is based on continuous trade with the US. Having a manufacturing business within the US. No minimum threshold. On the other hand there has to be substantial and un going trade with the use for goods/services. At least a year of goods/services flowing into the US. Then demonstrate that the visa would expand it.

Not very common, but can happen under the right circumstances, if there is enough trade activity.

## E2 Visa

Minimum investment for an E2 Visa is £100k minimum.

### H1-B

- Requirements
  - The position offered by the US entity is a speciality occupation.
    - A position that requires a US Bachelors degree of its equivalent in a related field.

If you don't have a degree, you can look at equivalents.
Substituted years of experience at a 3-1 ratio.

E.g. someone out of high school would need 12 years of experience to be the equivalent of a 4 year bachelors degree.

- You have to get a degree evaluated to see if it is equivalent to a 4 year US bachelors degree (e.g. a 3 year UK one).

Fist obstacle is the degree requirement.

You can cobble together education, so 2 years uni level education + 6 years of experience could be used as a 4 year degree.

- An advanced degree - masters or above can be substituted 

There is nothing stopping you from getting an evaluation to see if you could get a visa.
- 3rd party credentials evaluation service.

What constitutes a related degree is controversial. There are trying to narrow it down.
- Computer Engineering may be preferred to Computer Science.
- There is a chance that the person in immigration may skim over your application and give it the go ahead.

English Major was approved a H1B for a software engineering role.
- They got a little lucky. This is an extreme example.

If someone already has a H1-B in the US, it gives them added flexibility to move to another company.
H1-B transfer - foreign national from company A has an offer from company B.

There is a H1-B lottery, a limit, a quota. Every year the US rejects 150k+ H1-B visa petitions for people that are suitably qualified.

Mostly, people aren't undercutting wages via H1-Bs.

There hasn't been enough supply.

Every year, the first 5 days of april is the filling window for H1-Bs. Usually 300k petitions in this time frame. Will choose 85k, then reject the rest.

Just last year the system changed, and they instituted a new system, which includes pre-registration. A simplified application filed by the employer for the individual, just to see if it is selected.

You need luck to get a H1-B.

Window to pre file -> March 9th - March 25th.

Cases that are selected get a 3 month filing window.

Earliest possible starting date for CAP petitions:
- Gets selected in the pre-registration lottery.
- Then it gets approved. (it could be challenged).
- Then the earliest possible start date would be October 1st 2021, for a maximum of 3 years.

Green card process is started by a company for an individual once they have moved over.

One thing you can use to your advantage using the pre-registration process. $10 registration fee, and a simplified form that needs to be filed. May encourage companies to try and see what happens.

If you can take 1 thing away, TAKE OWNERSHIP OVER YOUR VISA PROCESS. This will serve you well. You will likely need additional help.

The Company has to file on your behalf. The H1-B doesn't include your signature. But you must be involved in the petition that they are filing on your behalf.

## Dual Representation

In the context of employment based temporary visa categories I am representing the company and individual.

### You need for H1B

- Company documents.
- Proof of credentials
- Letter from the company
- LCA -> certified form from the department of labour, acquired by the company, including occupation and wage to be paid.

## Remote working

- 10-99 for remote work vs W2 traditional.

Normal treated like a contractor.

From the UK on the visa waiver program.

Probably it is a market issue in terms of remote salary. If someone is working remotely, they are 10-99s, payed on an hourly basis, you don't get the standard company benefits, its probably cheaper. Also is likely company specific.

It's unusual to see someone working remotely who is treated the same as a W2 employee with benefits.

## L1

Need to be at the company for at least 1 year. No required wages like there are with H1-Bs.

Qualifiying company in a managerial/specialized role to work in a managerial/specialized role.

To be a manager, work needs to flow from you to other people. You need to be delegating.

Specialized knowledge - someone has been working for the company ~5 years, e.g. they are the architect of the software.

- L1-B -> specialized knowledge
- L1-A -> manager

Easier with larger companies.

## O1

8 Criteria, need to hit 3 of them.

- Published material about you.
- High renumeration.
- Leading or critical role with distinguished organizations.
- Speaking engagements.
- Judging the work of others.

Ultimately you need to be a leader and recognized for significant achievements in your field.

Someone with a 7 figure salary. They did a startup and sold it to company, it was well publicized in tech crunch, venture beat.
Often if it is a startup, they have funding, have been accepted into Y combinator.
They get various accolades and articles about them.

Reasonably rare and difficult. Usually the tech people who get this are entrepreneurs. The others are rockstars.

There are research based O1s for academics with citations.

If you are good at promoting yourself, you can help your chance at getting an O1.

### Overall Strategy

Take multiple approaches. Winding road, not straight forward. Can be back and forth.

Keep an eye on building up for the L1-A.

Wedge yourself in there, once they are willing to help, get a dialogue going with whoever is preparing your visa.
It increases your chances if you get that dialogue going.

Common strategy is remote, then you try to pursue remote.

### Social Media

Your online presence is all fair game. This applies to all requests for immigration benefits. Be aware of what is on your profiles.
There shouldn't be anything illicit.
Watch out, a profile that says you have been working in the US for x years, may be attractive to an employer, but to an immigration officer, that may look unlawful.

Usually what immigration officers want to know, is are you a lying sack of shit, or are you a truth teller.

You need to be cooperative, honest, transparent, when facing an adjudicator. They have a lot of discretionary power.

## Which companies?

Larger (100+ people) companies have done immigration work in the past.
- The tech giants are super familiar with it.
  - They may still not file every case - they are cost conscious, and savvy as to who will succeed.

Some companies who had a shit show and don't want to go there.

Then there are startups that are willing to do whatever is necessary.

### Canada

Canada is a lot easier than the US to get into.

You just get a work permit, it is much easier.

### Talking to companies

You can hire me now remotely, doesn't require a visa.

Then I can come over and visit, and there is H1-B lottery coming up that is not going to cost a lot to try.

### Questions

Which degrees would count? x

What is the visa waiver program?

Wages for remote workers in the US?

Which visa does a remote worker? -> DO NOT NEED A VISA.
