## What is implicit bias?

The attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions and diecisions in an unconcious manner.

Unconcious, unintentional, or subconcious bias.

## Case Study: Performance Bias (Gender)

Study of identical resumes - one with a man's name and one with a woman's name - found that 79% of applicats with a man's name vs. only 49% of those with a woman's name were 'worthy of hire'.

## Case Study: Performance bias (Race)

Resumes with white-sounding names received 50% more calls for interviews than identical resumes with black-sounding names. A "white" name is equivalent to about 8 more years of experience.

## How to recognize it yourself

- Project Implicit: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
- Take a mental note of 1st impression you had of someone - was it based on a stereotype.

## How to counteract it in yourself

- It doesn't make you a bad person
- Recognize the privileges that you have
- Try not to get defensive. If you get it wrong, apologize and take it as an opportunity to grow your awareness.
- Remember that giving your attention and time to those who are like you is an unconcious bias.

## Recognize it in others

- Mansplaining
- Talking over / interrupting
- Taking undue credit
- Actions based on assumptions based on race/gender/first/language/disability

## How to counteract it in others

- Iterrupt the interrupters - 'I'd like to hear the end of what Victoria had to say'
- Attribute carefully - Acknowledge idease and celebrate others' successes
  - E.g. Shoutouts=
- Speak up and/or reach out
- Recognize your own privileges

## What to do if you're on the receiving end of it

- Recognize that you may have an implicit bias against yourself
- Speak up and/or reach out.
- Just a second, let me finish my thought first.
- I brought that up earlier, so it's great to hear we are all on the same page.

## Microaggressions

- Microaggressions are defined as the everyday, subtle, intentional - oftentimes unintentional - interactions or behaviors that communicate some sort of bias toward historically marginalized gorups.
- Often appear to be a compliment ora joke, but contain a hidden insult about a group of people.

- Intention vs. impact.

## Why this matters

- Pairing
- Production Projects
- Leadership/Hiring
- Diverse teams drive innovation
- "When leaders embody diversity... they create a 'speak-up' culture
- At firms with diverse leaders, employees reported they were:
  - 60% more likely to see their ideas developed or prototyped
  - 75%

Calling in/calling out.

## My comments

It is about how we make these split second judgments and decisions, below the level of concious awareness.

The point about thinking it is a problem that is with other people.

Appreciate the fact
