# Imposteer Syndrome

Reid Klarsfeld -> 5-7 year goal -> spend a couple years at a bigger company -> then go to a startup -> then start his own company.

## Notes

You deserve to be here.

This is an open conversation.

### Paul Ramirez's story

Was surprised that this session happened at all. It is rare that we actually talk about this on any kind of development course.

Paul was like, eh imposter syndrome is something other people experience. Felt very confident going in. Then solo project hit, and suddenly you are left alone by yourself with this giant challenge.

Paul really wondered, is this what coding is like? Is coding really for me? Spent three hours yesterday working on a single drop down menu. He was thinking, I am the sort of person who can really succeed in this?

He took an advanced Physics course, and everyone else in the course knew way more about quantum physics. He then decided he is not a math or science person,  then that allowed him to change the feeling of what he wanted to do. He ended up becoming a humanities person, and going to be lawyer, taking the route he less wanted to take.

The goal is to put the work in. Put the time in.

### Cara Dibdin's story

It's the people that keep trying that win. They started with algorithms and data structures, and she really digged that. Then react hit and she was crying her eyes out.

Be the unconditional support that you're going to need someday. You may think you're doing really bad one week, then it's okay the next week.

Each detail is precious and valuable.

### Andrei Cabrera

When he came to codesmith, he was feeling that he knew everything. Was thinking I am going to kill it, I'm on top. Forget about being the best, forget about being the one who knows everything. It is a marathon. Save every single peice of information that Codesmith is going to give you, because you are going to need it.

Struggled with the snake game. The person your working with, they are your best friend.

### Matt

He thinks it's born it not knowing what you are doing. You should embrace that.

Matt pushes with a certain approach with an application at work. He wanted to connect one more thing in it. Had no clue what he was doing, at that point he went, I am going to learn how to do this!

Transform the imposter monster as energy, to overcome the challenges in front of you!

## Lanre

Imposter syndrome is part of we should have as engineers. When we get to the field, sometimes you get pull requests of things you cannot understand.

Lanre felt pretty strong at the start of the program. By the time he got to the 7th month, then the imposter monster reared its head. Webpack and production project hit. Initially this was demoralizing. If you can learn to overcome it, it is pretty much going to be your style.

We will struggle. He likes to think of imposter syndrome as a backpack, something you always carry with you. Embrace the struggle, share your story with everyone.

Learn to embrace, and let it be the fuel to help you overcome and create solutions.

It's not a competition, it's all about the community.

## Reid Klarsfeld

There is no way you're going to understand react in one week.

It's not about learning every aspect of react. It's about learning how to learn.
