## Shadowing a Technical Interview

- Have the fellow start a zoom with you and share their screen and audio
- Make sure the shadowers are muted
- Interviewer should then join the google hangout

## Pre Interview

- Interviews are assigned in Asana
  - Codesmith Technical Interviews - Asana board
  - They are rescheduled regularly
    - Hence check before hand
  - Be prepared to help with interviews for all programs
  - Review the Tech Interview Onboarding doc
- Try not to have the same fellow interview the same person more than once
  - If you have already assigned yourself for a candidate, do no reassign yourself to them!
- Remember that you should start taking technical interviews no later than week 1 of the program
  - Take 2 interviews per week

## Accountability

- If an interview get rescheduled and you cant make it
  - Drop the interview
    - Let the admissions team know you've dropped it
    - If it's less than 2 business days away
      - Slack Laura/Ashanti to let them know
- If there are not enough interviews to go around
  - Don't be that person if you can avoid it.
- If you pick up an interview and need to drop it because of conflict:
  - If it's more than 2 business days away => remove yourself from asana
  - Less than 2 business days away => slack Ashanti/Laura
- The admissions team will review how many Technical Interviews you do

## Preparation

- Search #notes-for-tech-interviews channel for any notes on the applicant. Search by email
  - If you don't see notes, DM the Admissions Coordinator for the program to confirm that you are still starting the interview on level 1
  - OTHERWISE YOU WILL WASTE EVERYONE'S TIME
- Confirm whether the interview is onsite or remote
  - All interviews are currently remote
  - Remote = google hangouts link in the calendar

## Interview Setup

- Make sure the workspace is setup ahead of time
- csbin.io/interview/{{interviewee's name}}

## The Technical Interview

- Be kind and welcoming
- Read the 'How to Start An Interview' prompt to the interviewee - make sure to hit on EVERY piece
- Once you are done answering any questions, confirm the following:
  - Cohort Start Date ("What cohort are you aiming for?")
  - Interview Number ("I want to confirm this is your X technical interview?")

## Prompt to Read to Interviewee

## During the Interview - Flow of Questions

- Guidelines for releasing questions:
  - Level 1: start with one level 1 problem, then move on to level 2 if they easily solve the first question
    - Lvl 1 qs assess Variable & Functional Declaration, for loops & iteration
  - Level 2: the applicant should complete two level 2 problems before moving on to level 3 (unless otherwise noted by admission)
    - Lvl 2 assesses Control Flow & Logic, Callbacks & Higher Order Functions
  - Level 3: should complete two level 3 problems before moving on to level 4
    - Lvl 3 assesses closure & recursion
  - Level 4: very difficult questions involving complex logic, highest level given on the interview (similar to Senior Hack Hours)
    - Should really only be used so we can see applicants hit a tough block

## During the Interview - Best Practices

- If a candidate does not show up after 5 mins, you can logout and let the coordinator know
  - Post in PTRI tech interview scores - no show
- You can give "guided recommendations" to interviewees if they are really stuck
  - Good rule of thumb - if someone isn't going anywhere for 5-10 mins, thats a good time to jump in
  - Remember we are scoring on analytical problem solving and debugging, so use your best judgement
- If the interviewee is not communicating, you can let them know they should explain their thought process and code
- Make sure that the candidate hits a block/gets stuck in each interview
- Ask them free flow questions, can be from the list of your own questions based on their interview
  - This is good if there is not much time left, but say you want to know what their understanding of say clojure is

- You can put unicorn emojis on your review

## At the End of the Interview

- Make sure that the candidate learns something in each interview
  - Walk them through whatever they get stuck on, whiteboard etc.
- Do NOT give feedback directly to the student (even if they ask how they did)
- Ask if they have any questions about the program
  - If they start asking a lot of questions, it's okay to say 'I'll have the admissions team send you a link to schedule a call with an academic advisor'
- Try to keep interviews to 60-70 mins total (we don't want you spending two hours on one interview!)
  - Writing the notes should not take an additional 40 mins

## Pair Programming Technical Interview

- Will appear on Asana like a normal interview, but you can tell from the notes in the #notes-for-tech-interviews channel
- This means they have NOT been accepted yet
  - You fill out the technical interview form
  - Switch driver/navigator roles
  - Can use qs from from JS fundamentals
- There can several reasons for the interview to be conducted this way
  - Usually to assess technical communication
  - Cultural concerns
  - Deep dive on a certain topic
    - We also sometimes to do this to ease the nerves for the interviewer

## Pair Programming Session for Accepted Students

- Already accepted (ex/ NAME: Codesmith New York Immersive, Pair Programming for Accepted Students)
- No need to fill out the form
  - Still check #notes-for-tech-interviews channel
    - If you don't see any ping the Admissions Coordinator!
- Best practice to send notes (if you have any) from the session to Admissions Coordinator

## Admin: After the Interview

- Submit form in a timely manner
  - Include special circumstances in your notes e.g. bad internet connection
- After you have submitted it, post in #la/ny/ptri/ftri-tech-interview-scores channel
  - Samantha Salley (1st Interview) - 9/8/10/9/8 - Accept
  - Schno Mozingo (3rd Interview) - 6/7/7/5/4 - SR 4 weeks (SR means soft reject)
  - Phillip Troutman (1st Interview) - No Show

## Scoring

- THEY NEED 2 LEVEL 3 PROBLEMS SOLVED TO SCORE 8

- Score the interviewee in each of the following categories
  - JavaScript Experience
  - Technical Communication
  - Non-Technical Communication
  - Analytical Problem Solving
  - How Do They Handle Working Through Blocks
- Use the guidelines on the interview form when scoring for each category
  - Scores 8 and up are considered passing
  - If you are suggesting that an applicant be rejected off a category, make sure your scoring reflects that!
